# Madness - flexible and convenient tool for DDoS attacks
## Architecture
Madness uses a simple architecture built around the "requests" module, which sends a request about the site's status to the server, thereby overloading it.
## Desing
Madness is designed in a green hacker style. It features an ASCII title, a skull, and a menu.
